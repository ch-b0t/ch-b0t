## Tjenare 👋 I'm an Australian programmer living in Sweden. 

### 🔭 I’m currently working on:
- **Google Permission Auditor**: Audit WHO has access to your google workspace, and visually graph it so you can get a clear picture. Code to come soon!
- **Consultant**: I write windows applications for mining maintenance contractors back home in Western Australia. If you have any small annoying problems at work, hit me up and Ill write something to solve it!
- **Founder**: Founder of an endless runner game called Peak Hour, where you play as a tyre rolling down the road dodging traffic. I started this in 2022 but put it on hold for university, and now I'm back to get it off the ground. In need of a cofounder, so hit me up if you're interested!

### 🤔 Past noteable projects:
- **[Trump Tweet Guesser](https://www.trumpguesser.com/)**: Exactly as it sounds. Guess which tweet was authored by big Don! (* *peaked at 10k monthly players* *)
- **[Kanye Tweet Guesser](https://www.kanyeguesser.com/)**: Another game exactly as it sounds - guess if Ye wrote it or not! (* *peaked at 5k monthly players* *)
- **[AI Slop Detector](https://github.com/ch-b0t/AI-slop-detector)**: Chrome extension where you can highlight text and it gives you a probability it was AI generated. Really helpful when scrolling LinkedIn 😉. *Idea was first created in the [Loveable Build Night Hackathon](https://www.uuais.com/events/U7qnXCLIGHqnWDYGICYe)*.
- **[Steganography in Videogames Research](https://medium.com/@Connor_Harris/sending-secret-messages-in-video-games-b9a8074a1184)**: Independent research to see if you could write secret messages in videogames by spraying messages onto walls. Yep, it was possible - new steganography method for the toolbox!
- **[Bucket Sort in C](https://github.com/ch-b0t/Bucket_Sort)**: Performance benchmarking tool for processors, portable to most linux OS's. Barebones tool to see how well your processor can run multithreading programs & how much data it can hold in the processor caches.
